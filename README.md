# BootCamp Project

This repo is meant to act a check on the members' progress towards
a script that can generate artifical training data found
[here](http://docs.uavaustin.org/guides/image-rec/training-data/basic-image-manipulation.html).

This repo will use Github Actions to check submitted code. 

## Objective

Create a branch called `bootcamp-yourname` where `yourname` is really your name.

Create a script, with the aid of the guide, that will:
- Create the script and call it `main.py` and place it in the root of this project.
- Download necessary resources if they are not present locally.
- Construct **10** artifical images and save them to `images`.
